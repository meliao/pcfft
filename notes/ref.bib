Mathematically, if the fluid is only partly covered by a plate or membrane, the order of derivatives of the surface-boundary conditions jump between regions of the surface. In this work, we consider a general class of problems for infinite depth linearized surface waves in which the plate or membrane has a compact hole or multiple holes. For this class of problems, we describe a general integral equation approach, and for two important examples, the partial membrane and the polynya, we analyze the resulting boundary integral equations. In particular, we show that they are Fredholm second kind and discuss key properties of their solutions. We develop flexible and fast algorithms for discretizing and solving these equations, and demonstrate their robustness and scalability in resolving surface wave phenomena through several numerical examples.}, note={arXiv:2510.22748 [math]}, number={arXiv:2510.22748}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Askham, Travis and Goodwill, Tristan and Hoskins, Jeremy G. and Nekrasov, Peter and Rachh, Manas}, year={2025}, month=oct, language={en} }
